# How will you know when the problem is solved? (Identify the big-picture goal)

# 1. The problem is solved when the customer realises that they have called
# the wrong number and hang up by saying goodbye. 

# 2. The software allows for user input and provides a response based
# on user input 

# 3. The customer service provider greets the caller.  
     # "HELLO, CAN I HELP YOU?"
# 3.1 The customer service provider waits for input from user. 

# 3.2 IF user is does not provide input or hit the enter key the program cannot proceed. 

# 3.3 If the customer hits the enter key, the service provider says "HELLO?!"

# 3.4 If the customer inputs a string in lower-case, the customer service provider 
# responds "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU."

# 3.5 If the customer inputs a string with upper-case latters, the customer service provider
# responds "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"

# 3.6 The first time the customer inputs "GOODBYE!", the customer service provider responds
# "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?"

# 3.7 The second time the customer inputs "GOODYBYE!", the service provider responds with "THANK
#  YOU FOR CALLING"

# 3.8 The string "THANK YOU FOR CALLING" ends the program.
